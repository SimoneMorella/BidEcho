# BidEcho
BidEcho is a commerce-auction Website entirely made in pure HTML, CSS and JS.
The project started thanks to CS50W. A project-exercise to pass their course was a commerce WebApp similar to Ebay.
Instead of simply doing the exercise I completely personalized the website doing also the front-end.
The concept of the website is making bid and auctions to items that people can put. 
The main theme is echo as it is possible to see from the link below.

The website is working completely. The backend works through Django and it can do many different stuff:
- Register;
- Login;
- Logout;
- Insert item to sell;
- Bid and making offers on items that aren't yours;
- Close the auction for items that you own;
- Filter items by categories;
- Comments on each items if the auction is still open;
- much more.

The front-end was made as an exercise without using any framework. It is everything full HTML, CSS and JS.
It is fully animated through CSS keyframes and responsive on every device.

The media-queries in particular were really challenging to write and I learned a lot through it about fluid design :)

Here the link to the (website video)[https://youtu.be/DocdivknjGs?si=owBKf1uHgrOQu03_] on Youtube.

In the next days I will host the website somewhere for everyone to try!

Thanks!
